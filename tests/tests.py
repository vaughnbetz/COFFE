'''
Test flow guide:
This test flow goes through all final spice simulation results and compares the rise and fall delays with a given reference.
Its objective is making sure that:
	1) Different features in COFFE are not broken after code changes.
	2) All spice simulations are completed without error.
	3) delay values of individual components are within reasonable range of reference.
