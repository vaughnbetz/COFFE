COFFE
=====

COFFE is a tool to create the circuitry and area, delay and power models for FPGA tiles (logic, RAM or heterogeneous tiles like DSP blocks).

If you make changes to COFFE, run the test.pl script to do some basic checks that existing functionality still works. It runs a small number of architectures to confirm COFFE can successfully create the output files, and confirms that the area output per tile is close to the expected value.
